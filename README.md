# LearnPY
A python based search system for 'python library functions'

# Introduction
python being an open-source language has become so vast that remembering all the functions and modules becomes hard for a student during exams, So we put our heads together to find a solution where a student can search for different library functions by specifying the task they wanted to do

## How is it different

google is a perfect competitor for this kind of job. Still, since we had an academic use case for this project where teachers can not condone plagiarism, hence a complete search system was developed where you can just search the libraries and nothing else

# TechStack

this project works with the concept of knowledge graphs and bert-embeddings to find the similarity index. A example of the knowledge graph is uploaded as an html file in the repository

# Note

this is just the backend Python development project, with no front-end to play around with it.
